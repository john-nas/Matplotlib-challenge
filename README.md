## Observations and Insights 

The two top drugs from this trial are both Capomulin and Ramicane. All the other drugs had very similar results to the placebo as shown in summary statistics.

The mice with the highest weight correlated quite highly with average tumor size. It is reasonable to conclude with a strong r-value correlation (0.83) from the linear regression.

The study had an almost completely even gender split (Female:49.4%, Male 50.6%) which shows a fair sample size for equal effectiveness amongst the genders.
